**Introduction**
The EndSars movement, which gained momentum in Nigeria and beyond, has sparked important conversations about police brutality, accountability, and social justice. This GitHub repository houses a project focused on applying topic modeling techniques to analyze textual data related to the EndSars movement. The goal is to uncover key themes, trends, and discussions within the dataset, shedding light on the diverse perspectives surrounding this critical socio-political issue.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is available here:https://www.kaggle.com/code/wadudambali/endsars-tweet-topic-modelling/input.
It comprises textual data from various sources, such as social media posts, news articles, and public discussions, capturing the multifaceted nature of conversations related to the EndSars movement. The dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the language used, sentiments expressed, and topics discussed during this period of activism.

**Project Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources used for the EndSars Topic Modelling project. The implementation utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful topics from the textual data. The findings aim to provide insights into the narratives, concerns, and sentiments expressed by individuals participating in or affected by the EndSars movement.
